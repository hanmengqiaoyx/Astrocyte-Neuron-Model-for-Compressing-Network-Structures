# Astrocyte-Neuron-Model-for-Compressing-Network-Structures

Please put the datasets into the 'Astrocyte-Neuron Model' file. Then, the program can be run via "python train.py" in each model. Among them, the MiniImageNet dataset needs to be processed through the file 'Processing_MiniImageNet' to generate training and test datasets.
